# nowNoise  

**nowNoise** is a social music discovery app built with **React Native** (frontend) and **Flask** (backend), powered by the **Spotify Web API**.  
Our mission is simple but powerful: **put music discovery back in the hands of real people ‚Äî not algorithms.**  

Instead of endless recommendation feeds, nowNoise fosters a **community-first model** where users share, explore, and connect through real-time listening.  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress:** nowNoise is still in active development. Core functionality is live (Spotify login, swipe-based exploration, and backend logic), but we are continuously refining the experience, UI, and recommendation algorithm.
